Porting a console application to the web involves reworking its user interface and possibly its architecture to function in a web environment. Your approach depends on a few factors, like the programming language it's written in, whether it's interactive or long-running, and how much you want to rewrite.

Here are the **main options** you have:

---

### ðŸ”„ 1. **Compile to WebAssembly (WASM)**

**Use Case:** If your app is written in C/C++/Rust and you want it to run directly in the browser.

#### Steps:

* Compile to WASM using tools like Emscripten (for C++) or wasm-pack (for Rust).
* Create a simple HTML/JS interface to interact with the compiled WASM.

This keeps the logic the same but runs it client-side.

---

### ðŸ’» 2. **Wrap It with a Web Terminal (for Minimal Changes)**

**Use Case:** If your console app is interactive and you'd like a "web terminal" feel.

#### Tools:

* **Xterm.js**: A web-based terminal emulator frontend library.
* **Shellinabox**, **Wetty**, **ttyd**: Web-based SSH clients that can display your console app.

This allows users to interact with your console app via a browser as if they were in a terminal.

### ðŸ§© 3. **Expose WebAPI**

**Use Case:** If your app has logic you want to keep, but you need a web interface.

#### âœ… Steps:

* **Keep your backend logic** (in whatever language it's written).
* **Expose core functionality as a web API** (e.g., using Flask, FastAPI, ASP.NET, etc.).
* Build a **frontend using HTML/CSS/JS** (or React, Vue, etc.).
* Call the backend via HTTP (AJAX/fetch).

#### Example stack:

* Core App: (You core app)
* (Optional): Wrap Core App in Docker
* Backend: Python (Flask, FastAPI, Django, ASP.NET)
* Frontend: React or plain HTML/JavaScript
* Hosting: Vercel, Netlify (frontend), Heroku or Fly.io (backend)

### How to Choose:

| Criteria                            | Best Option                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1. Performance, offline use         | WebAssembly                         |
| 2. Minimal changes, show terminal   | Web terminal (ttyd, Xterm.js)       |
| 3. Expose WebAPI                    | API (ASP.NET) + frontend (React)    |

My Choice: Webassembly
