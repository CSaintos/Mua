ToDo:
- NumberUtils should be a Number class that is its own library.
- Turn static libraries into dynamic libraries (this will require having postbuildcmds).
- I believe our Error class should use exceptions instead, but in such a way that doesn't halt the program.
- FIXME UnaPlus is not digit independent
- We can still further decouple the project
- FIXME something weird is going on when making project. Compilation is repeated.

Notes Opened:
