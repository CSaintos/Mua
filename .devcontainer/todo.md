ToDo:
- NumberUtils should be a Number class that is its own library.
- Turn static libraries into dynamic libraries (this will require having postbuildcmds).
- In some shape or form we need to reduce the decoupling such that I can get real threaded builds.
- I believe our Error class should use exceptions instead, but in such a way that doesn't halt the program.
- FIXME UnaPlus is not digit independent
