ToDo:
- NumberUtils should be a Number class that is its own library.
- I believe our Error class should use exceptions instead, but in such a way that doesn't halt the program.
- We can still further decouple the project (probably need to do some research on Dependency Inversion)
- Separate console output use from the busineess logic. Also remove use of exit calls.
