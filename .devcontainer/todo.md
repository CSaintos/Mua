ToDo:
- NumberUtils should be a Number class that is its own library.
- I believe our Error class should use exceptions instead, but in such a way that doesn't halt the program.
- FIXME UnaPlus is not digit independent
- We can still further decouple the project (probably need to do some research on Dependency Inversion)
- Separate data from behavior with State pattern on all child nodes.
- Bugfix all issues in math.mua
- Remove all header file intros (serves no purpose)
